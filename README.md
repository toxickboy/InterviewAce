## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or newer recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [Firebase CLI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

### Local Configuration

1.  Create a `.env` file in the root of your project. This file is for **local development only** and should **not** be committed to Git.
2.  Add your local development keys to the `.env` file:
    ```.env
    # For Google Generative AI
    GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"

    # For Razorpay (Test Mode)
    RAZORPAY_KEY_ID="YOUR_RAZORPAY_TEST_KEY_ID"
    RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET="YOUR_RAZORPAY_TEST_KEY_SECRET"
    NEXT_PUBLIC_RAZORPAY_KEY_ID="YOUR_RAZORPAY_TEST_KEY_ID"
    ```
3.  Ensure your `src/lib/firebase.ts` file is configured with your Firebase project details.

### Running the Development Server

To run the app in development mode, use the following command:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002) with your browser to see the result.

## üöÄ Deployment

This application is configured for deployment using **Firebase App Hosting**.

### 1. Set Up Secrets in Google Cloud

Your production API keys must be stored securely in Google Cloud Secret Manager. **Do not commit your `.env` file with production keys.**

- Go to the [Secret Manager](https://console.cloud.google.com/security/secret-manager) in your Google Cloud console.
- Create secrets for `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `RAZORPAY_KEY_ID`, and `RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET`.
- Grant the **Secret Manager Secret Accessor** role to your App Hosting service account (`service-<PROJECT_NUMBER>@gcp-sa-apphosting.iam.gserviceaccount.com`).

The `apphosting.yaml` file is already configured to use these secrets.

### 2. Deploy Manually

To deploy your application for the first time or for manual updates, use the Firebase CLI:

```sh
# Login to Firebase
firebase login

# Initialize App Hosting (only once per project)
firebase init apphosting

# Deploy the backend
firebase apphosting:backends:deploy
```

### 3. Automated Deployment with GitHub

For continuous deployment, connect your GitHub repository to Firebase App Hosting:

1.  Push your project to a GitHub repository.
2.  In the Firebase console, navigate to **App Hosting**.
3.  Follow the prompts to connect your GitHub repository.
4.  Configure the deployment to trigger from your main branch.

Now, every `git push` to your main branch will automatically build and deploy a new version of your application.
